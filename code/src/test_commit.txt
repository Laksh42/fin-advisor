1. Overview of OpenShift

What is OpenShift?
OpenShift, developed by Red Hat, is an enterprise-grade Kubernetes platform that provides additional tools and services to manage containerized applications. It builds on Kubernetes with added capabilities such as enhanced security policies, developer tools, CI/CD integrations, and a powerful web console for managing resources.

Why use OpenShift?

Enterprise-Ready: Built-in security and multi-tenancy.
Developer Experience: Rich web console and CLI (using oc) streamline app development and deployment.
Built-in CI/CD: Integrates with tools like Jenkins or Harness for continuous integration and delivery.
Scalability & Automation: Native Kubernetes orchestration with added management layers.
Operational Efficiency: Offers features like auto-scaling, self-healing, and integrated logging and monitoring.
2. Core Concepts and Components in OpenShift

A. Projects
Definition: Projects are the primary organizational unit in OpenShift, similar to namespaces in Kubernetes.
Usage: Each project isolates resources (deployments, services, pods, etc.) and provides RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) boundaries.
Practical Tip: Create a project using oc new-project <project-name> to logically separate environments (development, staging, production).
B. Builds
Purpose: The build process converts source code into a container image.
Components:
BuildConfig: Defines the strategy (source-to-image, Docker build, etc.) and triggers.
ImageStream: Acts as a versioned pointer to images built from your code.
Workflow: Code commit → Trigger BuildConfig → Generate image → Update ImageStream.
C. Deployment Mechanisms
Deployments/DeploymentConfigs:
Deployment: Kubernetes-native way of managing stateless applications.
DeploymentConfig (DC): OpenShift-specific abstraction providing advanced deployment strategies (rolling, recreate, blue-green, etc.).
Pods: The smallest deployable units that run your containerized applications.
Services: Provide stable networking endpoints for accessing pods.
Routes: Expose services externally, handling HTTP/HTTPS traffic.
ConfigMaps and Secrets:
ConfigMaps: Store non-sensitive configuration data.
Secrets: Securely store sensitive data like passwords or API tokens.
Inventory Section in OCP Console:
The OCP web console organizes resources under a project. In the “Inventory” panel you typically see:
Deployments/DeploymentConfigs: Application rollout details.
Pods: Running instances of your containerized app.
Services: Internal load balancing endpoints.
Routes: External access points.
ConfigMaps & Secrets: Application configuration and secure data.
Each resource has detailed views for logs, events, and underlying YAML/JSON configurations.

3. End-to-End Deployment Process with Harness Integration

Harness is a modern Continuous Delivery (CD) platform that automates deployments across Kubernetes environments, including OpenShift. Below is a detailed step-by-step guide integrating Harness with OCP:

Step 1: Preparation
Set Up Your OCP Environment:
Create a project:
oc new-project my-microapp
Ensure you have access credentials and the oc CLI installed.
Source Code and Repository:
Organize your code (with microfrontends and service backend) in a version-controlled repository.
Include Dockerfiles or S2I (Source-to-Image) configurations as required.
Step 2: Building the Application
Configure BuildConfig in OpenShift:
Define a BuildConfig that specifies the build strategy (S2I or Docker).
Example using S2I:
apiVersion: build.openshift.io/v1
kind: BuildConfig
metadata:
  name: my-microapp-build
spec:
  source:
    git:
      uri: 'https://github.com/your-repo.git'
  strategy:
    sourceStrategy:
      from:
        kind: ImageStreamTag
        name: 'nodejs:14'  # or your base image
Triggers: Configure webhooks to trigger builds upon code commits.
Step 3: Deployment Pipeline in Harness
Connect Harness to Your OCP Cluster:
In Harness, add your OpenShift cluster credentials (API endpoint, token, certificate) as a deployment target.
Set up a connector that maps to your project/namespace in OpenShift.
Create a Pipeline:
Build Stage:
Integrate your repository and trigger the build process.
Harness can kick off an OpenShift build via API calls or webhooks.
Deployment Stage:
Configure the deployment step that tells Harness how to deploy your image.
Leverage Kubernetes manifest deployment templates that point to your DeploymentConfig.
Configure parameters (e.g., replica count, environment variables from ConfigMaps and Secrets).
Verification Stage:
Set up automated tests or manual approval steps.
Harness can monitor the rollout status and health checks.
Pipeline Execution:
When the pipeline runs, Harness instructs OpenShift to:
Pull the latest image (from ImageStream).
Update the DeploymentConfig.
Initiate a new rollout.
Harness can continuously monitor for issues and automatically roll back if health checks fail.
Step 4: Behind the Scenes – What Happens in OpenShift
Image Deployment:
The new image is scheduled into a pod, and OpenShift’s scheduler places it on a node.
Service and Route Configuration:
The Service ensures that pods are grouped, providing a stable endpoint.
The Route exposes the Service externally.
Rollout Process:
The DeploymentConfig initiates a rolling update. It creates new pods while phasing out the old ones, maintaining service availability.
Resource Updates:
ConfigMaps and Secrets are mounted into pods as environment variables or volumes. Changes to these can trigger pod restarts if configured.
Step 5: Debugging and Monitoring
Using the OpenShift Console:
Inventory Views:
Monitor pods, deployments, and events.
Drill down on any pod to see container logs, resource usage, and event history.
Log Aggregation:
Utilize the integrated logging stack (Elasticsearch, Fluentd, Kibana) if set up.
Using the CLI:
Check Pod Logs:
oc logs <pod-name>
Describe Resources:
oc describe pod <pod-name>
oc describe deploymentconfig <deployment-name>
Events and Troubleshooting:
List events to catch errors:
oc get events
Harness Feedback:
Harness dashboards show deployment status, success metrics, and alerts.
If a deployment fails, Harness can trigger automated rollback procedures based on predefined health checks.
Step 6: Advanced Debugging
Debugging Failed Builds:
Check Build logs:
oc logs bc/my-microapp-build
Inspect build pods for errors.
Debugging Rollouts:
Monitor deployment events and health probes.
Use oc rollout history and oc rollout undo if needed.
Environment-Specific Configurations:
Use ConfigMaps and Secrets to differentiate between environments (e.g., staging vs. production).
Verify that environment variables are correctly injected in pods by checking the pod's configuration.
4. Practical Sections of the OCP Portal

When you log in to the OCP web console, you’ll encounter various sections:

Dashboard: Overview of your projects and resource usage.
Projects: A list of namespaces with a summary of each project’s resource statuses.
