# Multi-Modal Financial Advisor Chatbot

## Overview
The **Multi-Modal Financial Advisor Chatbot** is a cutting-edge solution designed to offer **hyper-personalized financial product recommendations**. Developed as part of the **Wells Fargo AI/DHP Developer Acceleration Hackathon**, this chatbot leverages **Generative AI techniques** and **multi-modal inputs** (text, images, and voice) to dynamically tailor financial advice based on user profiles, historical transaction data, sentiment analysis, and real-time behavioral inputs.

## Product Vision
Our vision is to empower users with an **intelligent digital advisor** that understands their financial habits and needs, adapting in real-time to provide **personalized recommendations**. This approach aims to revolutionize customer engagement in the financial sector, moving from **generic advice** to a **dynamic, data-driven model** that fosters trust and loyalty.

## Key Features & Capabilities

### 1. Multi-Modal Input Processing
- **Textual Interactions**: Users engage via natural language chat, processed by sophisticated NLP models.
- **Image Analysis**: Users can upload financial documents (e.g., receipts, statements) that are analyzed to extract relevant information.
- **Voice Input (Planned/Future)**: The architecture is designed to incorporate voice commands for enhanced accessibility and personalization.

### 2. Personalized Financial Recommendations
- **Dynamic Adaptation**: The recommendation engine continuously learns from user behavior, adapting its suggestions over time.
- **Meta-Prompt Generation**: Personalized meta-prompts create contextualized user sessions for more accurate responses.
- **Multiple LLM Integrations**: The system intelligently selects between AI providers (OpenAI GPT, Mistral AI, Hugging Face models) based on availability and specific use-case needs.

### 3. Robust Authentication & Data Security
- Secure user authentication and session management.
- Compliance with data privacy standards to ensure ethical and secure handling of financial data.

### 4. Real-Time Engagement & Adaptive Learning
- Captures **real-time interaction data** to refine financial recommendations.
- Implements **Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)** to improve AI-driven suggestions continuously.
